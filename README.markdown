* To set it up in your tumblr account, you'll have to do it via 'Customization' in your admin interface at tumblr. There you have to change it to _custom HTML_ and paste the code inside the `.html` file you got from here, save and _voila_.

* To set up comments with Disqus, you'll have to follow instructions in 'Install' at your Disqus account. The html code has already a commentary where disqus code should go. The same for Google Analytics and such.
